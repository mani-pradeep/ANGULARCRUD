# ANGULARCRUD

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.5.

## Installing JSON server for the first time

Run `npm i json-server` in the terminal to install JSON server in your local system. This has to be done only once, before you run the project for the first time.

## Starting JSON server

Run `json-server --watch db.json` to start the JSON server where the employee details are stored temporarily. This has to be done before each time before you start the project. After starting the JSON server, if you visit `http://localhost:3000/posts/` you will be able to see the existing data in the server.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
